# 💡 Example AI Interaction

### Student

```text
Explain recursion in C with a simple example.
```

### LearnMate AI

```text
Recursion is a programming technique where a function
calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem.

Example:

int factorial(int n)
{
    if(n == 0)
        return 1;

    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

The AI can additionally provide:

* Simple explanation
* Step-by-step execution
* Example
* Practice questions
* Quiz
